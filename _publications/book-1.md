This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to financial econometrics, covering fundamental theories and practical applications, with a focus on R programming. It offers an in-depth understanding of how econometric methods are applied in the context of financial markets, institutions, and instruments. The book is designed to address critical issues such as price formation, risk measurement, and policy transmission, making it an essential resource for both students and professionals in the field.

The content is structured from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, including regression analysis, time series models, ARCH/GARCH models, nonparametric methods, asset pricing models, continuous time models, and yield curve modeling. Special emphasis is placed on volatility models, risk management, and tail risk estimation, with the final chapters exploring the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning with financial econometrics.

The book is particularly focused on practical applications using R language, ensuring that readers not only gain theoretical insights but also acquire hands-on skills for data analysis and model implementation. Each chapter is paired with runnable code examples and exercises, offering a step-by-step guide for readers to apply econometric methods to real-world financial data.

This work is intended for graduate students, advanced undergraduates in economics and finance, and professionals engaged in quantitative finance and economic research. It is ideal for those who seek a thorough, practical understanding of financial econometrics, with the added benefit of mastering R as a tool for financial analysis and modeling.
