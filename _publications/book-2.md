## Abstract

This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the development and applications of **Financial Technology (FinTech)** in China. It covers the key components of **FinTech**, including **digital payments**, **blockchain**, **big data**, **cloud computing**, and **artificial intelligence (AI)**, and their role in transforming the financial services sector.

The book is designed to address both the **theoretical foundations** and **practical applications** of FinTech. It discusses the **technological innovations** driving **FinTech**, the **regulatory challenges**, and the **policy implications** for both China and the global market. The textbook also highlights case studies and real-world applications to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

This work is ideal for **graduate students**, **advanced undergraduates**, and professionals in **economics**, **finance**, and **technology** who seek a thorough understanding of the role of technology in the financial services industry, with a particular focus on the Chinese market.

The textbook also emphasizes practical skills, with a focus on coding exercises, case studies, and examples that allow readers to apply **FinTech** principles to real-world scenarios.
