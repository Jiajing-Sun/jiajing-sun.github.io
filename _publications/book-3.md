**“Econometrics and Time Series Methods: Theory, Applications, and R Implementation”** covers a wide range of topics including **regression models**, **univariate and multivariate time series**, **volatility modeling**, **nonparametric and semiparametric methods**, **HAR inference**, **autoregressive filtering and state space models**, **nonstationary processes**, **continuous-time finance**, and **machine learning**. The book emphasizes hands-on implementation in **R**, with extensive examples based on real financial and macroeconomic data, aiming to integrate *theory, methods, empirical applications, and computation* in a unified way.

The textbook is supported by a complete **teaching ecosystem**, including open-source lecture slides and a dedicated **course website** ([https://quantinar.com/course/1033/econometrics-and-time-series-methods-theory-applications-and-r-implementation](https://quantinar.com/course/1033/econometrics-and-time-series-methods-theory-applications-and-r-implementation)), as well as an accompanying **GitHub repository** of R code ([https://github.com/QuantLet/Econometrics_R](https://github.com/QuantLet/Econometrics_R)). These resources make it easy for instructors to adopt the book and for students to engage in self-study, especially in fully English-taught and international programs.
