## Abstract

This policy report examines the UK's trade policy in the context of its net-zero emissions goals and offers strategic recommendations to align trade practices with sustainable environmental objectives. Through the use of the Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) model, the report identifies the UK as a significant net importer of carbon emissions, contributing to global climate change through its consumption patterns. The research highlights the paradox in middle- and low-income countries, where innovation and increased R&D can unintentionally lead to higher emissions, exacerbating carbon leakage and hindering global efforts to reduce carbon footprints.

The report also discusses the UK's current trade challenges post-Brexit, including the imposition of non-tariff barriers and the lack of cohesive environmental standards in trade agreements. It emphasizes the need for a unified green trade policy, strengthening climate policies like carbon taxes, and enhancing international collaborations to ensure that trade practices are aligned with global emission reduction targets.

The policy recommendations advocate for a comprehensive green policy framework, the development of accurate carbon accounting mechanisms, and a focus on fostering innovation in green technologies. Additionally, the report suggests that aligning with international mechanisms such as the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) could help the UK navigate trade complexities while maintaining its commitment to net-zero emissions.
