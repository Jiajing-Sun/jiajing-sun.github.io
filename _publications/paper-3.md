## Abstract

We consider how the governmental and political contexts of societies affect the delivery of decarbonization agendas. Data on government effectiveness and political stability (capability) and voice and accountability (responsiveness) are related to emission levels in high and middle/low-income countries. The analysis implied that greater government effectiveness initially decreased, but then increased emissions. Alternatively, improvements in political stability had no effect in high-income countries, but lowered emissions elsewhere. Increasing voice and accountability had no effect on the emissions of high-income countries, but raised then (at higher levels) lowered emissions in middle and low-income countries. Findings are used to develop a scholarly understanding of the effects on complex public policy outcomes.
