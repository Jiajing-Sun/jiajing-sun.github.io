This course focuses on **financial econometrics**, covering the core theories and methodologies used to model and analyze financial data. As the **lead instructor**, I provided lectures on the key econometric techniques and their applications in finance, including **asset pricing models**, **market efficiency**, **volatility forecasting**, and **derivative pricing**.

### Course Content:
1. **Introduction to Financial Data**:
   - Characteristics of **financial data** and sources of data.
   - Overview of time series models relevant to financial data analysis.

2. **Predicting Financial Returns**:
   - **Market Efficiency** and its implications for asset pricing.
   - **ARMA Models**: Autoregressive moving average models.

3. **Predicting Market Volatility**:
   - Introduction to **ARCH** and **GARCH** models for volatility forecasting.
   - **EGARCH** models for asymmetric volatility.

4. **Event Study Methodology**:
   - Analysis of **abnormal returns** and testing abnormal returns using a cross-sectional approach.

5. **Asset Pricing Models**:
   - Review of **CAPM theory**, **empirical testing** of CAPM, and **multifactor pricing models** (e.g., **Arbitrage Pricing Theory**).

6. **Present-Value Relations**:
   - The relationship between **prices**, **dividends**, and **returns**.

7. **Derivative Pricing**:
   - Introduction to **Brownian motion**, **Black-Scholes**, **Merton models**, and the **martingale approach**.

8. **Nonlinear Financial Data Models**:
   - **Bilinear models**, **piecewise linear models**, **TAR**, **STAR**, and **SETAR models**.

### Additional Topics:
If time permits, we will explore more advanced topics such as **spectrum analysis**, **Kalman filters**, **Markov regime-switching models**, and **high-frequency data models**.

### Teaching Methodology:
This course combines **theoretical instruction** with **practical applications** using real-world **financial data**. The course uses **R programming** and **MATLAB** for data analysis and model implementation.

**Hours**: 40 hours
