This course focuses on **financial statistics** and **econometrics**, designed for postgraduate students. The aim is to equip students with the skills needed to analyze and model **financial data** using advanced **econometric** and **time series methods**. As the **lead instructor**, I guided students in applying these techniques to real-world financial datasets.

### Course Content:
1. **Introduction to Financial Data**:
   - Characteristics of financial data and how to acquire financial data.
   - Overview of **time series models** for financial data analysis.

2. **Market Returns**:
   - **Market Efficiency**: The theory of **efficient markets**.
   - **ARMA Models**: Autoregressive moving average models.
   - **VARMA Models**: Vector autoregressive moving average models.
   - **Event Studies**: Analysis of **abnormal returns** and tests on abnormal returns.

3. **Predicting Market Volatility (Risk)**:
   - Introduction to **ARCH family models** (e.g., **ARCH**, **GARCH**, **EGARCH**).

4. **Stochastic Volatility Models**:
   - Introduction to **state-space models** and **Kalman filter** techniques.
   - Estimation of **stochastic volatility (SV) models** using **Gibbs sampling**.

5. **Asset Pricing Models**:
   - Review of **CAPM theory**, **empirical testing** of the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**.
   - **Multifactor asset pricing models** (e.g., **Arbitrage Pricing Theory**).

6. **Present-Value Relations**:
   - The relationship between **stock prices**, **dividends**, and **returns**.

7. **Derivative Pricing**:
   - Introduction to **derivative pricing models**, such as **Brownian motion**, the **Black-Scholes model**, and the **martingale approach**.

### Teaching Methodology:
The course combines **theoretical** instruction with **practical applications**. Students were provided with the opportunity to analyze **real financial data** and apply econometric models using **R programming**.

**Hours**: 40 hours
