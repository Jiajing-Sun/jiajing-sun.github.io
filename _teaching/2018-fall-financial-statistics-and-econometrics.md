This course focuses on **financial statistics** and **econometrics**, aimed at developing students' ability to analyze and model **financial data** using both **traditional econometric methods** and **time series models**. As the **lead instructor**, I guided students through topics such as **asset pricing models**, **market efficiency**, **volatility modeling** (e.g., **ARCH/GARCH**), and the pricing of **financial derivatives**.

### Course Content:
1. **Introduction to Financial Data**:
   - Characteristics of financial data and sources of data.
   - Introduction to time series models for financial data analysis.

2. **Market Returns**:
   - **Market Efficiency**: The theory of efficient markets.
   - **ARMA Models**: Autoregressive moving average models.
   - **VARMA Models**: Vector autoregressive moving average models.
   - **Event Studies**: Analysis of abnormal returns, testing abnormal returns.

3. **Predicting Market Volatility (Risk)**:
   - Introduction to **ARCH family models** (e.g., **ARCH**, **GARCH**, **EGARCH**).

4. **Stochastic Volatility Models**:
   - Introduction to **state space models**, **Kalman filter**, and **Stochastic Volatility (SV) models**.
   - Estimation of SV models using **Gibbs sampling**.

5. **Asset Pricing Models**:
   - Overview of **CAPM theory**, **empirical testing of CAPM**, and **multifactor asset pricing models** (e.g., **Arbitrage Pricing Theory**).

6. **Present-Value Relations**:
   - The relationship between **stock prices**, **dividends**, and **returns**.

7. **Derivative Pricing**:
   - Models for pricing **financial derivatives**, including **Brownian motion**, the **Black-Scholes and Merton models**, and the **martingale approach**.

### Teaching Methodology:
The course is designed to combine **theoretical learning** with **practical application**. Students worked with **real financial data** and applied the methods using **R programming**.

**Hours**: 40 hours
