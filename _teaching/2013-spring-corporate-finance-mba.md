This **MBA course** covers the fundamental principles of **corporate finance**, including **capital budgeting**, **financing decisions**, and the **cost of capital**. As the **lead instructor**, I guided students through the application of these concepts to real-world corporate situations, helping them understand the financial decision-making process within firms. Topics such as **financial leverage**, **dividend policy**, and **merger and acquisition (M&A)** were also explored in-depth.

**Hours**: 40 hours
