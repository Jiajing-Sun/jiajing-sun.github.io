This **postgraduate econometrics course** was taught as part of the **Jinan-Birmingham Joint Institute (JBJI)**. The course focused on the key methods in **econometric modeling**, including **regression analysis**, **time series analysis**, and **panel data**. Students were taught how to apply econometric techniques to real-world data. 

As the **lead instructor**, I provided practical examples and guided students through hands-on exercises using **R programming** to analyze complex datasets.

**Hours**: 20 hours
