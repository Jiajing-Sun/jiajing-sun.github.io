This **undergraduate econometrics course** covered key methods in **regression analysis**, **time series modeling**, and **panel data analysis**. The course aimed to provide students with both the theoretical foundations and practical skills needed to analyze economic and financial data.

I taught students how to apply econometric techniques using **R programming**, including creating and interpreting **time series models** and **volatility forecasting**. I wrote dedicated **R handouts** and **exercises** to reinforce key concepts and provide practical experience with real-world datasets.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Regression Analysis**: Linear and non-linear models, including **ordinary least squares (OLS)** estimation.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Introduction to **stationarity**, **autocorrelation**, and **unit root tests**. 
- **Volatility Models**: **ARCH/GARCH** models for predicting financial market volatility.
- **Panel Data**: Estimating models with both cross-sectional and time-series data.
  
**Hours**: 20 hours
