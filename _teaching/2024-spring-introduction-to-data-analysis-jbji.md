This **undergraduate module** introduces students to the fundamentals of **data analysis** using **R programming**. The course covers essential topics such as **data structures**, **statistical analysis**, **probability distributions**, and **data visualization**. As the **lead instructor**, I wrote a **dedicated handout** for the course, which covers key concepts and provides practical exercises for students to work with real-world datasets.

### Course Content:
1. **R Programming Fundamentals**:
   - Basic **mathematical operations** and **constants in R**.
   - Working with **loops**, **data structures**, and **functions** in R.

2. **Data Manipulation and Analysis**:
   - **Subsetting**, **filtering**, and **aggregating** data in R.
   - Preliminary **data analysis** and introduction to **statistical techniques**.

3. **Data Visualization in R**:
   - Basic **line plots**, **histograms**, and **scatter plots**.
   - Advanced visualization using the **ggplot2** package.

4. **Probability Distributions**:
   - **Discrete** and **continuous distributions**, including **Binomial**, **Poisson**, **Normal**, and **Exponential distributions**.
   - Introduction to **Monte Carlo simulations**.

5. **Conditional Probability and Independence**:
   - Concepts of **conditional probability**, **Bayes' theorem**, and **independence**.

6. **Limit Theorems**:
   - Introduction to the **Law of Large Numbers** and **Central Limit Theorem**.

### Teaching Methodology:
The course is taught entirely in **English**, with **English** slides and materials. Students learn both the **theoretical concepts** and the **practical implementation** of data analysis techniques in **R programming**.

**Hours**: 40 hours
