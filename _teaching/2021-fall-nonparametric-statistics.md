As the **lead instructor** for this course, I taught **nonparametric statistical methods**, including hypothesis testing, the **Mann-Whitney U test**, and **Kruskal-Wallis test**. Students were trained in applying these methods to real data, with a focus on understanding their applications in economics and finance.

**Hours**: 40 hours
