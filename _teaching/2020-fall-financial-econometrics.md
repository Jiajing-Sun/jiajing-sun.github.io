In this course, I taught **financial econometrics** with a focus on **asset pricing models** and **volatility forecasting**. Students were introduced to advanced econometric tools such as **GARCH models**, **copulas**, and **machine learning** methods. The course covers key topics like **time series modeling**, **ARCH/GARCH models**, **nonparametric methods**, **asset pricing**, **volatility modeling**, and **risk management**. As the **lead instructor**, I guided students through real-world applications using **R programming**.

The course integrates **theory**, **methodology**, **empirical applications**, and **computation**. It emphasizes **economic interpretation**, **statistical testing**, and **robustness analysis** to ensure practical applicability in **financial econometrics**.

**Hours**: 40 hours
