This course focuses on advanced **time series analysis** techniques, including **cointegration**, **VAR models**, and **state-space models**. The course also covers **regression models**, **univariate and multivariate time series**, **volatility modeling**, **nonparametric and semiparametric methods**, **HAR inference**, **autoregressive filtering**, and **continuous-time finance**, with an emphasis on real-world **financial** and **macroeconomic data**. As the **lead instructor**, I provided students with the skills to model complex financial and economic time series data.

The course aims to integrate **theory**, **methodology**, **empirical applications**, and **computation**. The teaching ecosystem also includes open-source **lecture slides**, a **course website** ([Course Website](https://quantinar.com/course/1033/econometrics-and-time-series-methods-theory-applications-and-r-implementation)), and **GitHub repository** for **R code** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/QuantLet/Econometrics_R)), supporting students' learning and research.

**Hours**: 60 hours
