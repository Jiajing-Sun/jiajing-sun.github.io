title: "Online Monitoring of Structural Change with Adjusted-Range Self-Normalization"
excerpt: "This paper proposes an **adjusted-range-based self-normalized sequential monitoring scheme (RSMS)** for online change-point detection, offering significant improvements in performance, especially in the presence of structural shifts. The method avoids tuning parameter choices, making it more robust and efficient for high-frequency data."

This **working paper** introduces a **novel sequential monitoring approach** for detecting structural changes in time series using **adjusted-range-based self-normalization**. The method addresses the limitations of existing techniques, such as CUSUM procedures that require long-run variance estimation, by providing a **tuning-free solution**.

### Key Contributions:
- **Adjusted-range self-normalization** enhances sensitivity to structural changes, particularly under large shifts in the data.
- Developed **simulation-based critical values** that ensure robustness in detecting changes, even when the training sample is mildly contaminated by undetected breaks.
- **Empirical analysis** using USD/GBP exchange rate data from the 2016 UK referendum and the 2020 COVID-19 crisis shows that the proposed method delivers timely alerts and outperforms standard methods (e.g., SSMS and CSMS).

**Impact**:  
This paper significantly contributes to the **field of time series analysis**, providing a practical and efficient tool for **real-time monitoring** of financial and economic data. The **RSMS** method is expected to be widely applicable in areas such as **market surveillance**, **risk management**, and **financial forecasting**.
