title: "Membership Rules and the Pricing of Local Public Goods: Evidence from China’s Hukou System"
excerpt: "This working paper explores how residency as an institutional membership rule affects access to **local public goods** (such as schooling, healthcare, and housing) through pricing and queue priority in China’s Hukou system. The study uses an original survey of **1,565 respondents** across Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou to quantify **user prices** and **realized inflows** at **enforcement gateways**."

This **working paper** examines the role of **residency** (Hukou) as an **institutional membership rule** that influences the pricing of **local public goods** in China. We introduce a **novel framework** to assess how residency impacts **migration**, **sorting**, and **welfare**, particularly in relation to **congestible services** such as **education**, **healthcare**, and **housing**.

### **Key Academic Contributions**:
- **Original Survey**: An innovative survey conducted in 2018 with **1,565 respondents** across **Beijing**, **Shanghai**, and **Guangzhou**. The survey goes beyond self-reported satisfaction and eligibility rules by measuring both **out-of-pocket expenditures** and **realized transfers** at **enforcement gateways** (e.g., medical reimbursements, housing transfers). This allows us to directly observe **effective user prices** and **queue priority**, a critical and often unobservable aspect of membership-based pricing.
  
- **Economic Framework**: We model **residency** as a **membership rule with a pricing schedule and a conversion technology** (e.g., employer sponsorship/points). The framework predicts that **lower user prices for insiders** raise **utilization and satisfaction**, and that **wages** and **residency value** trade off along **indifference curves**.

### **Key Findings**:
- **Pricing Works as Intended**: **Insiders** (those with Hukou status) spend more and report higher satisfaction in congestible services. Medical reimbursements are strongly influenced by **residency status**, reflecting **point-of-use verification**.
- **Residency–Wage Trade-Off**: **Migrants** exhibit a clear substitution between **wages** and **residency value** in terms of overall utility.
- **Sector Technology**: High-tech employment raises **income** and **job satisfaction** for **migrants**, but not for locals, suggesting that sector-specific **productivity** amplifies the returns to **insider status**.

### **Policy Relevance**:
- **Practical Applications**: The paper’s findings have important **policy implications** for improving **welfare** while maintaining **fiscal discipline**. The results suggest ways to:
  1. **Compress the price wedge** between insiders and outsiders, through **harmonization**.
  2. **Increase portability of entitlements** at the point of use, such as making access to healthcare or education more uniform across regions.
  3. **Allow targeted, transparent conversion** of non-insiders' status, particularly in sectors with high technology.

### **Global Relevance**:
This framework generalizes to other residency-based systems such as **residence permits**, **in-state tuition**, and **municipal housing lists**. Where eligibility is enforced at gateways, insiders face lower **user prices** and better **queue priority**, while outsiders face rationing or higher prices. The **membership rule**, **pricing schedule**, and **conversion technology** concepts can be applied globally in similar settings, such as the U.S. or Europe.
