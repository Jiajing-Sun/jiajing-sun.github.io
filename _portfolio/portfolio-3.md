title: "Megaregion Enlargement and the Geography of Gains: Evidence from the Yangtze River Delta"
excerpt: "This working paper studies how the **2013 enlargement of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD)** reshaped the **geography of gains** across incumbents, entrants, and adjacent non-members. The paper uses **synthetic controls** and **event-time designs** to show that the enlargement increased **per-capita GDP** growth by **1.6 percentage points per year for incumbents** and **0.5 percentage points per year for 2013 entrants**, with weakly negative effects for nearby non-members."

This **working paper** explores the economic impacts of the **2013 enlargement of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD)**, focusing on how the integration reshaped the **geography of gains** for incumbent, new, and non-member cities. Using **city-specific synthetic controls** and **event-time analysis**, we show that the **megaregion enlargement** increased **GDP growth** by **1.6 percentage points per year** for incumbents and **0.5 percentage points per year** for entrants, while non-member regions experienced weakly negative effects.

### **Key Academic Contributions**:
- **Comprehensive Incidence Mapping**: The paper quantifies **who gains where** from enlarging an **existing megaregion** (as opposed to merely adding new links), with clear **policy boundaries** distinguishing the impacts on incumbents, entrants, and non-members.
- **NEG-QSM Synthesis**: We synthesize **New Economic Geography (NEG)** and **Quantitative Spatial Models (QSM)** to derive testable propositions about how **capital reallocation**, **industrial upgrading**, and **labor adjustments** affect the distribution of gains from megaregion integration.
- **Portable Design**: The **methodology**—using **synthetic control methods (SCM)** with **long pre-trends**, **cohort-specific event-time analysis**, and **moderation tests**—can be applied to other **polycentric regions** like the **EU corridors** or the **Greater Bay Area**, making the results generalizable beyond China.

### **Key Findings**:
- **Incumbents** experienced the largest gains, with **1.6 percentage points** of increased GDP growth per year after the expansion.
- **2013 entrants** saw modest growth of **0.5 percentage points** per year, while **non-members** experienced weakly negative effects.
- **Capital misallocation** decreased for members, while **upgrading** increased within the region, though **labor adjustments** lagged—consistent with **hukou**, housing, and skills frictions.
- The **GDP impact** scaled convexly with **baseline size and centrality** of cities and attenuated where advancement was already high.

### **Policy Implications**:
- The study suggests **policy strategies** to promote **integration** by:
  - Compressing **insider–outsider price differences** and reducing **inequality**.
  - Enhancing **labor-market easing** and expanding **access to services** for non-members, to further broaden the **geography of gains**.
  - Allowing for **targeted conversion** of non-insiders’ status in **high-tech sectors** to ensure more **inclusive growth**.
