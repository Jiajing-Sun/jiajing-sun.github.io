On **November 17, 2025**, I had the honor of inviting **Professor Per Johansson** from **Tsinghua University** and **Uppsala University** to present at the **8th Seminar on Statistics and Data Science**. The seminar, titled **"Comparative Effectiveness Evaluation Using Historical Controls: A Framework for Analysis with High-Dimensional Electronic Health Record Data,"** was held at **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences**.

### **Abstract**:
Comparative effectiveness evaluations often rely on constructing treatment and control groups that are similar with respect to observed pre-treatment covariates. However, in the context of severe diseases, identifying a comparable control group is particularly challenging, as one reason for not receiving treatment may be early death. This seminar introduced a novel approach for identifying controls using historical patient data, applicable to individuals offered a newly introduced drug or affected by an emerging disease (e.g., COVID-19). 

The method leverages a two-level neural attention model, **RETAIN**, which accommodates high-dimensional, time-stamped health data to estimate individual-level propensity scores. This enables the selection of historical controls who would have had a similar daily risk of treatment (or disease onset) had the drug (or disease) been available during that period. 

Our approach addresses both confounding and length bias sampling, offering a robust alternative for comparative effectiveness research in settings where traditional control group construction is compromised by high mortality risk. The framework was demonstrated with an application to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, evaluating the effectiveness of a newly introduced hormone therapy compared to standard care.

### **Speaker Bio**:
**Per Johansson** is a **Professor of Statistics** at **Uppsala University** and a leading scholar in **causal inference** and **program evaluation**. His research develops methods for identifying **causal effects** in real-world settings, with applications in **labor and health economics**, **social insurance**, **education**, and **public policy**. His work has been published in top journals, including the **Journal of the Royal Statistical Society**, **Journal of Econometrics**, **Journal of Applied Econometrics**, **Journal of Business & Economic Statistics**, **Economic Journal**, **Journal of Public Economics**, **Journal of Human Resources**, and **Journal of Health Economics**.

**Per Johansson** was also a member of the prize committee for the **Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (2019-2024)**.

**Location**:  
- **Date**: November 17, 2025, 16:30-18:00  
- **Venue**: **Room S406**, **Zhongguancun Campus**, **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences**

The event was a great success, with a lively discussion on the application of advanced **statistical methods** in **healthcare research**. It was a fantastic opportunity for students and faculty to engage with cutting-edge work in **causal inference** and **comparative effectiveness research**.

I would like to thank **Professor Johansson** for his insightful presentation, and I look forward to more collaborative efforts in the future.

**Impact**:
This seminar contributed to **cross-disciplinary knowledge exchange** and helped to expand the **understanding of causal inference methods** in the context of healthcare and **medical data analysis**.
