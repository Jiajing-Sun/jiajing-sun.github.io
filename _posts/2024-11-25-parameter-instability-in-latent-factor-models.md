On **November 25, 2024**, I had the privilege of organizing a talk by **Professor Wang Xia** from **Renmin University of China**, as part of the **Department of Statistics and Data Science's Special Invited Talk Series (Session 2)**. The talk, titled **"Addressing Parameter Instability in Latent Factor Models: A Combined Discrete Fourier Transform Based Test"**, was held at **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences**, Zhongguancun Campus.

### **Abstract**:
The existence of **parameter instability** causes inconsistent estimation in **factor models**, particularly when using **principal component analysis (PCA)**, due to the violation of the constant factor loadings assumption. Structural changes often manifest in both the residuals and factors, making them difficult to detect using traditional methods.

In this seminar, **Professor Wang Xia** proposed a **combined test** to detect structural changes in the **factor loadings** by leveraging a **discrete Fourier transformation (DFT)** approach. This method combines information from both the **estimated residuals** and **factors**, allowing for **self-determined weights** to balance their relative significance.

Simulation results demonstrated that the **combined DFT-based test** provides reasonable size and superior power, especially for detecting abrupt breaks or smooth changes in large magnitudes. The **test was further applied to U.S. macroeconomic data** and **Chinese stock market data**, where it showed robustness and outperformed other methods, particularly in **financial data analysis**.

### **Speaker Bio**:
**Wang Xia** is a **Wu Yuzhang Distinguished Professor** at **Renmin University of China** and a doctoral supervisor. She was selected as a **national-level young talent** and received her **Ph.D. in Economics** from the **Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics, Xiamen University** in 2013. 

Her research focuses on **theoretical econometrics** and **macroeconomic monitoring and forecasting**. Professor Wang's work has been published in high-impact journals such as **International Economic Review**, **Journal of Econometrics**, **Journal of Business & Economic Statistics (JBES)**, and **Economic Research**. She has led multiple **National Natural Science Foundation** projects, including both **General Projects** and **Youth Funds**.

**Location**:  
- **Date**: November 25, 2024, 16:30-18:00  
- **Venue**: **Room S406**, **Zhongguancun Campus**, **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences**, Beijing, China  
- **Tencent Meeting**: [703-181-801](https://meeting.tencent.com)

This seminar provided valuable insights into **parameter instability** in **latent factor models** and demonstrated the practical application of **DFT-based tests** in **financial data analysis**.

**Impact**:
The seminar contributed to a deeper understanding of **econometric modeling** and **structural break detection**, offering a more robust method for analyzing real-world financial data.
