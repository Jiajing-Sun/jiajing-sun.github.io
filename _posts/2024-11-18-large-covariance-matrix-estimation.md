On **November 18, 2024**, I had the pleasure of organizing a talk by **Professor Li Dong** from **Tsinghua University**, as part of the **Department of Statistics and Data Science's Special Invited Talk Series (Session 1)**. The talk, titled **"Large Covariance Matrix Estimation with Factor-Assisted Variable Clustering"**, was held at **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences**, Zhongguancun Campus.

### **Abstract**:
This talk studies the estimation of **covariance matrices** for high-dimensional time series within a new framework that combines **low-rank factor** and **latent variable-specific clustering structures**. The popular methods based on assuming the **sparse error covariance matrix** after removing common factors may be invalid for many financial applications.

The proposed formulation introduces a **latent model-based error cluster structure** after removing observable factors, leading to more **interpretable clustering patterns** and accounting for non-sparse cross-sectional correlations among variable-specific residuals. The method starts with **least-squares estimation** of factor loadings, followed by the identification of the **latent cluster structure** through thresholding the scaled covariance difference measures of residuals.

A novel **ratio-based criterion** is introduced to determine the threshold parameter in the clustering algorithm. The talk also discusses the **clustering recovery consistency** and provides convergence rates for the covariance matrix estimators under different norms. **Simulations** and a **real data application** on **minimum variance portfolio** demonstrate the superior performance of this approach over existing methods.

### **Speaker Bio**:
**Li Dong** is an **Associate Professor** at the **Department of Statistics and Data Science**, **Tsinghua University**. He joined Tsinghua University in **September 2013** and primarily focuses on the **statistical analysis of complex time series**, **non-Euclidean data analysis**, **network data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **financial econometrics**.

**Location**:  
- **Date**: November 18, 2024, 16:30-18:00  
- **Venue**: **Room N513**, **Zhongguancun Campus**, **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences**, Beijing, China

This seminar highlighted cutting-edge advancements in **high-dimensional data analysis** and provided valuable insights into the application of **factor-assisted variable clustering** in **financial econometrics**.

**Impact**:
The seminar contributed to a deeper understanding of **covariance matrix estimation** and its applications in **financial portfolio analysis**. It also served as a platform for promoting advanced **statistical methodologies** in **financial data science**.
