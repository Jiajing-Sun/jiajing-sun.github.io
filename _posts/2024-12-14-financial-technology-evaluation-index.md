This **project** involves the **development of the Digital Financial Competitiveness Evaluation Index for Small and Medium Commercial Banks**, completed in **August 2024** after four years of extensive research and data analysis. 

The project is part of a larger initiative to assess the **financial technology competitiveness** of **small and medium-sized banks** in China. The evaluation index was developed by designing a comprehensive set of indicators based on five key dimensions: 
- **Financial technology strategy implementation**
- **Organizational structure**
- **Information technology governance and risk**
- **Technology operations and services**

We collected high-quality data from the **annual reports** of **541 Chinese banks** from **2015 to 2023**, including information on **organizational structure**, **financial data**, **patents**, **violations**, and **software copyrights**. We used **machine learning** and **text analysis** techniques to build a multi-dimensional model to assess the competitiveness of financial technology in these banks.

On **December 14, 2024**, I had the honor of presenting this evaluation index at the **China Financial Forum**. Experts have noted that the index is highly aligned with China’s **innovation-driven development strategy** and serves as a valuable tool for guiding small and medium-sized banks in their **market positioning** and **development strategies**.
