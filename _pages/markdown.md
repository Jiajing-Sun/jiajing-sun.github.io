This is my academic website, where I aim to provide as much **academic material** as possible, including **slides** for my books, **talks**, and the **handouts** for my **Introduction to Data Science** module. These materials are shared to support learning and foster academic discussions.

However, due to **copyright concerns**, not all of my **publications** will be available directly on the site. If you wish to access a specific publication, please check if it is available through public sources. If you cannot find it, feel free to **email me** at [jiajing.sun@gmail.com](mailto:jiajing.sun@gmail.com), and I will do my best to assist you.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope the materials provided are helpful for your studies and research!
