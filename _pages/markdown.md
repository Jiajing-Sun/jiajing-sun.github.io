This is my academic website, where I strive to provide as much academic material as possible, including slides for my books, **handouts** for my **Introduction to Data Science**,  **drafts** of my working papers, and more. These materials are shared to support learning and encourage academic discussions.

However, due to **copyright concerns**, not all of my **publications** will be available directly on the site. If you wish to access a specific publication, please check if it is available through public sources. If you cannot find it, feel free to **email me** at [jiajing.sun@gmail.com](mailto:jiajing.sun@gmail.com), and I will do my best to assist you.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope the materials provided are helpful for your studies and research!
