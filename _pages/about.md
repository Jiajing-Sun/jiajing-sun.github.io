# About Jiajing Sun

I am an **Associate Professor** and the **Deputy Director** of the **Department of Statistics and Data Science** at the **School of Economics and Management**, **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)**, located in Beijing, China. My primary research focuses on **econometrics**, **financial econometrics**, and the **intersection of data science and economics**.  

I am also a **Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)** and a **Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (FIMA)**. These professional qualifications reflect my strong academic background and practical experience in **finance**, **mathematics**, and **econometrics**.

In addition to my core research areas, I have a broad academic interest in **environmental management** and **environmental economics**. I have worked on projects related to the economic implications of **environmental policies** and **climate change**, exploring how econometric methods can be applied to **sustainable development**.
 
## Research Interests 

My research spans several domains within **econometrics**, with a particular passion for **financial econometrics**. I develop and apply innovative econometric models to analyze and predict economic and financial trends. One of my key areas of focus is **modeling financial markets**, particularly through **time series analysis**, **volatility modeling**, and **risk management**.

In addition, I have a broad academic interest in **financial risk management**. I have conducted foundational research for **regulatory early warning systems** in financial derivatives markets, specifically for the **China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX)**. This research focused on developing models and frameworks to identify potential risks in financial markets and improve the resilience of trading systems. Since 2021, I have also been developing the **Competitiveness Evaluation System for Financial Technology in Small and Medium Banks**, which includes creating evaluation indicators based on strategic implementation, organizational structure, IT governance, risk management, and technological services. This work involves the collection and analysis of data from 541 Chinese banks, using **machine learning** and **text analysis** techniques to build multi-dimensional assessments of financial technology.

In **August 2024**, I successfully completed the **Digital Financial Competitiveness Evaluation Index for Small and Medium Commercial Banks**, which was presented at the **China Financial Forum** on **December 14, 2024**. Experts have highlighted that this index aligns closely with China’s innovation-driven development strategy and provides valuable guidance to small and medium-sized banks for market positioning and development strategy.

## Academic Contributions

I have made significant contributions to **econometric methodology**, particularly in **time series analysis** and the **robust estimation** of long-run variances. I developed the **“Adjusted-Range Self-Normalization” (ASN)** framework, which provides a robust alternative to traditional methods of estimating long-run variances under conditions such as strong dependence and heavy tails.

In addition to these methodological contributions, I have authored several textbooks:

1. **“Financial Econometrics: Theory, Cases, and R”** (First Author), in collaboration with **Professor Hong Yongmiao** and **Professor Oliver Linton**. This textbook covers **regression analysis**, **time series modeling**, and **risk management**, with a focus on **R programming** and financial data analysis. It provides practical applications with running code and exercises, using publicly available data sources. The book is a comprehensive resource for graduate students, senior undergraduates, and professionals in quantitative analysis.

2. **“FinTech”** (First Author), in collaboration with **Professor Hong Yongmiao**, **Professor Wang Shouyang**, and **Dr. Yang Youwei**. This textbook provides a systematic overview of **financial technology (FinTech)** development and applications in China, covering core technologies such as **blockchain**, **big data**, **cloud computing**, and **AI**. It also explores practical applications in **digital payments**, **digital currencies**, and **regulatory technology**. The book is designed for university students in economics, finance, and related disciplines, as well as professionals in financial institutions and regulatory bodies.

3. **“Econometrics and Time Series Methods: Theory, Applications, and R Implementation”** (First Author), in collaboration with **Professor Hong Yongmiao** and **Professor Oliver Linton**. This English-language textbook covers a range of topics, including **regression models**, **univariate and multivariate time series**, **volatility modeling**, **non-parametric methods**, **machine learning**, and applications to real financial and macroeconomic data. It includes **R code** and extensive examples, designed for both classroom teaching and self-study. The textbook also has an accompanying **[website](https://quantinar.com/course/1033/econometrics-and-time-series-methods-theory-applications-and-r-implementation)** and **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/QuantLet/Econometrics_R)** for additional resources, making it accessible for a global audience of students and researchers.

## Broader Interests

Beyond my primary research, I am deeply engaged in **data science education** and **policy research**, particularly in **financial systems**. I am also passionate about **environmental management** and **environmental economics**. I have published in the **Journal of Environmental Management** and, in 2024, I contributed to the submission of written evidence on **UK trade** and **net-zero emissions** policy to the **UK Parliament’s Energy Security and Net Zero Committee**. This submission reflects my commitment to informing policy discussions with rigorous empirical analysis and evidence-based recommendations.

🔗 **[UK Parliament Written Submission](https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/129004/pdf/)**

I am also particularly interested in the role of **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** in shaping the future of **financial markets** and **economic policy**. I believe that interdisciplinary approaches, combining **economics**, **statistics**, and **data science**, are essential for solving the global challenges we face, from economic crises to environmental sustainability.

I regularly collaborate with international researchers to improve **policy decision-making** and **financial decision-making**. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the development of tools that can better inform public policies, foster innovation in financial markets, and enhance global economic resilience.
